In the final example of Chapter 1, I demonstrated how to calculate a dynamic
acceleration based on a vector pointing from a circle on the canvas to the
mouse position. The resulting motion resembles a magnetic attraction between
shape and mouse, as if some <em>force</em> was pulling the circle in
towards the mouse. In this chapter I will detail
the concept of a force and its relationship to acceleration. The goal, by
the end of this chapter, is to build a simple physics engine and understand how objects
move around a canvas by responding to a variety of environmental forces.
